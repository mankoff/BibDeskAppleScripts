* A link between pdfmeat.py and BibDesk

** Current Version

This version takes one selected BibDesk record, passes the PDF to
pdfmeat.py, and then transfers Volume, Number, and Pages from the
returned BibTeX record to the current record.

** Project Goal

+ Run on one or more selected BibDesk records.
+ For each record, if a title exists in the record, search Google
  Scholar using that information. Also use first author name if
  available.
  + Perhaps use a modified pdfmeat to do the search.
+ If a title does not exist and a PDF does, then use pdfmeat with the
  linked PDF

At this point, we should have a Google Scholar BibTeX record, called "newPub"

+ For each field in newPub, copy to existingPub if that field is blank
  in existingPub.
+ Remove newPub
